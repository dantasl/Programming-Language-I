## How to compile project

This is a simple code that generates static and dinamic libraries for Linux and Windows of a program that calculates area, perimeter and volume of different geometric shapes. It is under the namespace of <b>geometria</b> and the library's name is <b>lucas</b>.

* On command line, go to the directory where you've cloned this repository;
* Type <code><b>make init</b></code>;
* Type <code><b>make linux</b></code> to generate both static and dinamics libraries for Linux;
* Type <code><b>make windows</b></code> to generate both static and dinamics libraries for Windows.

You can also generate the Doxygen's documentation typing <code><b>make doxy</b></code> and clean the project with  <code><b>make clean</b></code>.
