# Programming Language I (Class notes and codes)

I'm storing here every assignement given in Programming Language classes. Each directory has its own README and Makefile, besides instructions of how to compile and make tests.

<b>Attention: Some implementations may contain errors. Most of them have been spotted so far, but I've decided to leave them. Here my learning curve (as well as my evolution as a programmer/computer scientist) can be observed.</b>

Enjoy and feel free to use/reproduce/distribute any piece of code in this repository, as long as you reference me.
